[New Feature] : added 'SetAxesLinesHoverable' function to move and scale gizmos;
[New Feature] : added 'SetMvAxesLinesHoverable' to universal gizmo;
[New Feature] : added 'SetMidCapHoverable' to rotation gizmo;
[New Feature] : added 'SetRtMidCapHoverable' to universal gizmo;

[Bug Fix]	  : Fixed 'RTObjectSelectionGizmos::SetWorkGizmo' bug;
[Bug Fix]	  : Fixed SphereTreeNode stack overflow exception;
[Bug Fix]	  : Fixed scale gizmo scaling object incorrectly;
[Bug Fix]	  : Fixed scale snap step for scale gizmo freeze in Inspector;
[Bug Fix]	  : Fixed incorrect reporting of relative drag scale and total drag scale for scale gizmos;

Release 2.1.5.1
[New Feature]: added 'SetIgnoredParentObjects' function to the 'ObjectExtrudeGizmo' class;

Release 2.1.5
[New Feature]: added RTScene.Get.SetRootObjectIgnored function to instruct the scene to exclude
			   certain root objects from consideration;
[New Feature]: added button to sort prefab libraries alphabetically;
[Restored]	 : restored CanRenderCameraIcon event in the RTScene class;

Release 2.1.4
[New Feature]: the 'RTSCene.Get.AddIconRenderIgnoreCamera' function can now be used to specify cameras
			   that should not render scene icons;
[New Feature]: added min size property for the multi-select shape. This is useful when you need
			   to specify a minimum size at which the shape is able to overlap objects. This value
			   can be increased when small mouse movements cause objects to be selected accidentally;
[New Feature]: added RTObjectSelection.Get.ForceDelete() function. This is useful when the
		       selection needs to be deleted from code in response to a certain event;

[Improvement]: improved performance for the RTScene.Render_SystemCall a little bit by avoiding 
			   a call to CanRenderCameraIcon;
[Improvement]: click select is now performed on mouse button up which is consistent with how Unity
			   does things in the editor and also provides much more control over how objects get
			   selected with the multi-select rectangle;

[Bug Fix]	 : fixed bug which was preventing objects from being selected via click select when 
			   multi-select is turned off;

Release 2.1.3.2
[New Feature]: added RLDApp.Initialized event;

[Bug Fix]	 : fixed bug where holding down SHIFT to multi-deselect was causing all
			   objects to get deselected if a selectable object was hovered by the cursor;

Release 2.1.3.1
[Bug Fix]	 : fixed spawned prefab hiding behind terrain;
[Bug Fix]	 : fixed bug which was preventing correct interaction (gizmos, selection etc)
			   when a custom camera viewport was used;

Release 2.1.3
[New Feature]: added SetGizmosVisisble to the RTObjectSelectionGizmos class to allow the
			   client code to temporarily hide gizmos and prevent them from showing up again
			   when the selection changes;
[New Feature]: added 'Alternate move speed' property to the RTFocusCamera object which allows you
			   to change the speed at which the camera is moving (WASDQE). The alternate speed
			   is activated via SHIFT by default, but the hotkey can be changed in the Inspector;
[New Feature]: added 'RTObjectSelectionGizmos.SetGizmoUsable' function which can be used to ignore
			   gizmos in certain scenarios (e.g. certain objects should not be affected by certain gizmos);

[Bug Fix]	 : fixed bug which was throwing build errors due to Unity internal texture usage;

Release 2.1.2
[New Feature]: camera icons are now rendered in the scene;

[Improvement]: scene icons have been replaced with the icons that are used by Unity inside the Editor;

[Bug Fix]	 : fixed bug which was causing the focus camera to be selected;

Release 2.1.1
[New Feature]: implemented 'CreatePrefabFromSceneObject' and 'CreatePrefabsFromSceneObjects' functions
			   in the RTPrefabLib class. These are useful for creating prefabs at runtime;

[Bug Fix]	 : fixed scene gizmo look and feel not serialized;
[Bug Fix]	 : gizmo states such as enabling/disabling snapping can now correctly be activated/deactivated
			   using the gizmo interface. Previously, this was not possible because these states would 
			   always be overwritten by the hotkeys;

Release 2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[New Feature]: added 'Deletable layers' mask in the RTObjectSelection Inspector to control what
			   layers can be deleted;
[New Feature]: added 'ExtrudeUpdate' event to object extrude gizmo;

[Change]	 : removed 'IUndoRedoAction' param from 'CanUndoRedoHandler' delegate type;
[Change]	 : renamed the 'OOBB' class to 'OBB';

[Bug Fix]	 : fixed build errors for mobile devices;
[Bug Fix]	 : fixed GetZoomFactor() not calculating zoom factor correctly for transform gizmo classes;
[Bug Fix]	 : fixed object groups can not be added to database via Inspector when game objects are 
			   model prefab instances (disconnected or otherwise);
[Bug Fix]	 : fixed extrude gizmo handles inverted when object has negative scale;
[Bug Fix]	 : fixed argument out of range exception thrown from 'RTObjectSelectionGizmos' class;

Release 2.0 (complete rebuild - name changed to Runtime Level Design)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[New Feature]: universal gizmo (Move/Rotate/Scale all in one);
[New Feature]: object extrude gizmo;
[New Feature]: object-to-object snap;
[New Feature]: selection grid snap;
[New Feature]: multiple viewport support;
[New Feature]: greatly improved surface snapping capabilities (surface embeding, rotate and scale, 
			   adjust anchor, offset from surface, offset from anchor, rotate around anchor);
[New Feature]: rotate selection using the keyboard with configurable rotation steps;
[New Feature]: object groups (handy concept useful for customizing how objects get selected);
[New Feature]: cyclical click select - for each click, a different object will be selected from
			   a list of objects which are hovered by the mouse cursor. This is useful in certain
			   situations such as selecting overlapping sprites;
[New Feature]: new transform pivots: ObjectCenterPivot, CustomWorldPivot, CustomObjectLocalPivot;
[New Feature]: optional prefab management and runtime prefab picker;

[Improvement]: lots more gizmo customization options;
